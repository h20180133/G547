Project Summary: 
VUSB based alarm system
The objective of project is to sending threshold values for a LDR sensor via USB protocol. LDR Sensor is interfaced to ADC of Atmega8. The firmware of Atmega8 will compare the converted sensor value with threshold value sent from the userspace. If the ADC's converted value is higher than threshold value, there will be an alarm. The firmware part includes a C program that controls ADC channel selection and setting LDR and alarm initialisation to atmega pins. IOCTL calls are used to send threshold value. Libusb is also used to send threshold value. Four threshold levels(0 to 3) are defined for the sensor.Threshold level 0 indicates lowest value and threshold level 3 indicates highest value. 

Sensor Description:
Light Dependent Resistor(LDR) is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a LDR decreases with increasing incident light intensity.
LDR returns higher value when light intensity is less and returns lower value when light intensity is high.
